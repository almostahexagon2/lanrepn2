# lanrepn++

lanrepn++ idk why im making it with github but whynot

## intro 

### what was wrong with lanrepn
- the roots were too short to be distinct from echother
- cyrillic
- using other roots as suffixes is realy confusing
- the whole language became inconstent and confusing

### what did lanrepn do well
- forms
forms are a cool concept that i havent seen in any other language
- phonology
lanrepn's phonolgy was fine. I don't care what other jan Ewen cares about consonant clusters. Its **not** an interlang. Its not ment for people who cant pronounce consonant clusters; therefore Im going to use them to make the lanuage more efficent.

 
### why dont we all speak lanrepn
lanrepn was made for the SR and   ***there is no more sr***
