# lanrepn++

lanrepn++ idk why im making it with github but whynot

## intro 

### what was wrong with lanrepn
- the roots were too short to be distinct from echother
- cyrillic
- using other roots as suffixes is realy confusing
- the whole language became inconstent and confusing
- the word for <jan> (repnse) "unit of a comunity" is ***two*** sylables long.

### what did lanrepn do well
- forms
      forms are a cool concept that i havent seen in any other language
- phonology  
    lanrepn's phonolgy was fine. I don't care what other jan Ewen cares about consonant clusters. Its **not** an interlang. Its not ment for people who cant pronounce consonant clusters; therefore Im going to use them to make the lanuage more efficent.
- orthography  
    the "two-dimensional anti-line writing is a practical orthography that takes advantage of lanrepn's strict word structure


 
### why dont we all speak lanrepn
lanrepn was made for the SR and   ***there is no more sr***

## how is lanrepn++ gonna be better
First, `lanrepn++` or `lanrepn2` is a *temporary name* it *will* be changed to whatever the equvlant of lanrepn is in its succsessor or something like lanrepnido. This section is gonna be expanded mostly by repnseEwen cuz he disliked it the most. I think its gonna be mostly like lanrepn++-- but with variable length roots.

## main goals
- commlang(commuication language) for us
     - texting
     - discord
     - speaking
- lanrepn but better
- minimize syllable count(again but without making it anticomprehensible)
